## What is Alt-Tech?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alt-tech&oldid=1177420663&useskin=monobook)

Alt-tech are social media platforms and Internet service providers that have become popular among the alt-right, far-right, and others who espouse extremism or fringe theories, often because they employ less stringent content moderation than mainstream platforms. The term "alt-tech" is a portmanteau of "alt-right" and "Big Tech". In the 2010s, some prominent conservatives and their supporters began to use alt-tech platforms because they had been banned from other social media platforms. Alt-tech platforms describe themselves as protectors of free speech and individual liberty, which researchers and journalists have alleged may be a cover for antisemitism and terrorism.

## The Alt-Tech index

This project aims to be an index of alt-tech websites for the purpose of blocking, countering, documenting, and avoiding.

## Top 10

The top 10 most notable alt-tech websites. Logos are not yet included. All entries are listed as 2023, October 2nd, as that is when this project was started.
